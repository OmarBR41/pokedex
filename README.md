# Pokédex App

This repo is a fullstack Pokédex web application built using TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Docker.

The backend initially consumes the [Poké API](https://pokeapi.co) to populate the database with all the Pokémon's details, sprites, and text entries. The data is then exposed through an API.

The frontend consumes the API to list Pokémon along with their picture and details, search a Pokémon by their number or name, and add them to favorites.
